How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is crucial for long-term software development. To achieve this, I follow best practices such as using meaningful variable and function names, structuring my code with modularity, and adding clear comments to explain functionality. Specifically, in Project One, I implemented a CRUD Python module that efficiently connected the dashboard widgets to the MongoDB database. This modular approach allowed me to reuse the module in Project Two, making integration seamless. By maintaining a clean separation of concerns, my code remains flexible and can be adapted to future requirements. The CRUD module could be utilized in other projects that require database interactions, such as web applications or data analysis tools.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I first analyzed the database and dashboard requirements before designing the data flow and user interface. I ensured that each component functioned correctly before integrating them into the final dashboard. Compared to previous assignments, this project required a deeper focus on database interactions and user-friendly design. Moving forward, I would apply similar strategies—such as iterative development, thorough testing, and client feedback—to ensure that databases and applications meet specific business needs efficiently.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve complex problems through technology, enhancing efficiency and decision-making for businesses and organizations. In this project, my work contributed to Grazioso Salvare’s mission by providing an interactive dashboard to manage rescue animal data effectively. This allows the company to streamline its operations, track animal locations, and make data-driven decisions. Such applications are essential in various industries, from healthcare to finance, where data visualization and management tools play a crucial role in improving services and outcomes.
